# clogger

A blogging app written in clojure. The app is going to be mostly a display
tool. You'll write your posts in markdown format, save the files in the posts
directory and push the repo to where your app lives. It will support images
which will live in a parallel directory to posts. 

One command-line tool this will provide is a `lein new-post <post title>` which will 
create a template file for your post in the posts directory
